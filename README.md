# Software Progress:
- [x] Add IWDG to VCU 
- [ ] Handle migration from STM32F407VG to STM32F423VH 
- [ ] Use AES features in new STM32F423VH 
- [-] Decrease System Clock to 100MHz 
- [ ] Edit file database.c data type to structure 
- [x] Move all constant (config variable) to config.h file 
- [ ] Increase the baud-rate of all communication protocols 
- [x] Pass pointer of chars from Simcom_Response() to Simcom_Send() 
- [x] De-structure "stm32f4_discovery_audio.c" and "stm32f4_discovery.c" 
- [ ] Configure UBLOX if you order the IC separately, so build the library for it 
- [x] Handle AT Command of new SIM5300e 
- [x] SIM5300e TCP communication 
- [ ] SIM5300e SSL communication 
- [x] Add SIMCOM signal strength CAN and the display 
- [x] Handle command from Server to IOT 
- [-] MQTT Protocol with backend server 
- [-] Try to lock SIMCOM on 3G network, then fallback to 2G if failed continuously. 
- [x] Handle interrupted restart of SIMCOM module 
- [x] Day names in RTC is not editable yet 
- [x] Handle SIMCOM logs array when offline 
- [ ] EEPROM Emulation ? How about external EEPROM modules? 
- [ ] Handle DTR pin for SIM5300e (sleep mode) 
- [x] Handle HMI Secondary CAN 
- [x] Handle RTC reset when (no BMS & Li-ION empty), need sync RTC 
- [x] Standardize frame data which sent to server, ignore ATrack frame. 
- [x] Change HAL_Delay() to osDelay() 
- [ ] Something wrong with I2S DMA Data Width (it should be Half-Word, not Byte) 
- [-] Remove DMA_handler files 
- [x] Remove any un-necessary array, use pointer if possible for simplicity 
- [ ] Slow down report time when no BMS 
- [x] Calibrate audio volume 
- [ ] Use hierarchy algorithm to handle simcom error 
- [x] Encode Command Frame from Server to IOT 
- [x] Calibrate simcom signal level from db to linear 
- [ ] Handle "Phone Plugged Status" from HMI-2 
- [-] Set audio volume to max at first, then set to default. Because the external speaker has AGC. 
- [x] Check ACK on every REPORT / RESPONSE frame. If not receive ACK response, resend (2 times), then restart the SIMCOM if still failed. 
- [x] Check COMMAND before clearing the Buffer 
- [ ] Lock all global variable to minimize RTOS problem.
